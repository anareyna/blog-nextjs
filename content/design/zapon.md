### Client

Zapon (Luxembourg)

### Task

UX/UI designer

### Project Description

The task for this project consisted on a visual overhaul of zapon.com, a VC funded project based on an interest driven Social Network. The requirements were to make the website as pleasant and user friendly as possible.

Zapon.com is a Social Network based on your interests not specially on friends. By specifying your own interests you can join other people having the same interests to share “links”, “pictures”, “Videos” or chat in real-time with those people. This means that you define your proper social network based on your interests, instead of friendships. You cannot only join people interested in something (e.g. Design), but you can also define the geographical scope. Whether you want to get in touch with “Designer”s world wide or just in your country or city. By that zapon can create your own personal local community.
