### Client

GoMobileBI (Australia)

### Task

UX/UI designer

### Project Description

My task as a UX/UI designer in this project was to target both tablet and iPhone devices. Some of the requirements consisted in the following:

A standardized dashboard look and feel with a flat UI design, consistent with both the new iOS7 look and Windows 8 Modern UI (Metro style).

A mobile-first design approach to support touch gestures. Multiple layouts for a responsive application that adapts automatically to the target device form factors: tablets, smartphones and desktop PCs.

Design for multiple dashboard widgets for data visualization.
