Sublime Text is one of the fastest code editors that has emerged in recent years. It has a great community that produces a lot of packages (or plugins) to speed up the development of your projects. It supports OS X, Linux and Windows platforms.

If you are not using Sublime Text you can find more information and download version 2 [here](http://www.sublimetext.com/) or version 3 (beta) [here](http://www.sublimetext.com/3).

Today we will see some tips and packages that you might find very useful:

### Shortcuts

All shortcut combinations that come as default with Sublime are in the menu Preferences -> Key Binding – Default

If you want to edit or add a shortcut you have to find and copy the lines of code that you want to customize from the file “Key Bindings – Default” and paste it into the file “Key Bindings – User” from the same menu. Let’s say we want to bind this shortcut “ctrl + alt + c” to comment some lines of code, we would have to add the following lines in the “Key Bindings – User” file:

```js
{ "keys": ["ctrl+/"], "command": "toggle_comment", "args": { "block": false } },
{ "keys": ["ctrl+shift+c"], "command": "toggle_comment", "args": { "block": true } },
```

Other hidden Sublime feature and a time-saver is for copying or cutting lines of code, just place the cursor in any part of your code and press “ctrl + c” (no need to select the entire line) and you’re ready to paste it.

### Packages

In order to use packages you need to install “Package control”, just copy a block of code in the Sublime console (View menu -> Show console) and you’re ready to go. Follow the instructions in [this link](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation).

Once you have Package control installed, you can go to the Preferences menu -> Package Control -> Install Package or use the shortcul “ctrl+shift+p” to start searching any of the packages listed below.
