This app is designed to integrate with the [Splitwise API](https://dev.splitwise.com/), allowing you to easily split or share expenses with friends.

One of the features is converting an invoice picture to text, in order to detect the items and prices to be listed on screen, for this I'm using [Butler API](https://docs.butlerlabs.ai/reference/welcome).

The code is developed in Next.js (ReactJS), and deployed with Vercel.

### Front-end technologies:

-   NextJS
-   React
-   Javascript (ES6)
-   Tailwind
-   SCSS
-   MongoDB
-   Vercel
-   Third libraries API integrations
