Responsive portfolio website designed and developed by myself in order to display my work and experience over the years. This is a redesign and upgrade of my previous website using newer technologies and front-end tools.

The code is developed in Next.js (ReactJS), and deployed with Vercel. The contact form is saving the data to a MongoDB database.

### Front-end technologies:

-   NextJS
-   React
-   Javascript (ES6)
-   CSS Modules
-   SCSS (Styles)
-   MongoDB
-   Vercel
